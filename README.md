## About EasyReminder
I have created a Telegram bot for reminders. The main purpose of this bot is to help me with personal or work-related tasks by sending reminders. One of my initial goals was to develop a flashcard system, where I could practice language learning by storing and reviewing vocabulary words and phrases.

The bot serves as a convenient tool for managing and organizing reminders. It allows me to set specific dates and times for reminders, ensuring that I stay on top of important tasks and deadlines. Additionally, it has the ability to send recurring reminders at specified intervals, such as daily, weekly, or monthly.

One of the standout features of the bot is the integrated flashcard system. I have designed it to facilitate language learning by allowing me to input new words or phrases along with their translations or meanings. The bot will then present these flashcards to me at regular intervals using a spaced repetition algorithm, optimizing the learning process and improving long-term retention.

The user interface of the bot is intuitive and user-friendly. It provides commands and prompts that allow me to easily add, manage, and review flashcards, as well as set up and modify reminders. The bot also has a flexible notification system, ensuring that I receive reminders in a timely manner through Telegram messages or push notifications.

In summary, this Telegram bot serves as a reliable and versatile reminder tool, incorporating a well-designed flashcard system for language learning purposes. It simplifies the process of organizing tasks and aids in language retention through regular flashcard reviews.
